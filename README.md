Overview:

dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java.  It supports all defined record
types (including the DNSSEC types), and unknown types.  It can be used for
queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates.  It includes a cache which can be
used by clients, and an authoritative only server.  It supports TSIG
authenticated messages, partial DNSSEC verification, and EDNS0.  It is fully
thread safe.  It can be used to replace the native DNS support in Java.
